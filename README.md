# SP500-Screener

For our Modelling & Analytics project, our team created a tool that screens the S&P 500 to create fully indivualized portfolios based on investors needs.

for the SP500


. My code downloads the following data for each ticker in the S&P 500:
- Price Data 
- Industry
- Forward P/E | Profit Margins 
- Analyst Ratings
- Sustainability (Environmental | Social | Governance)
- Technical Indicators (RSI | MACD)
- Beta 

Our team created a simple interface so that we can find out the preferences and risk-tolerance of the user.  An investor can for example say that he wants to focus on companies with a high ESG-Score and wants to have a healthy risk-reward-ratio. 
Our tool uses the input to filter the database and create a customized portfolio. The portfolio gets optimized by choosing weights accordingly to the Efficient Frontier to reduce volatily and maximize profits.
